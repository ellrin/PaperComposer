//! PaperComposer core: loading a writing profile (phrase bank, vocabulary,
//! rules), validating it, retrieving phrases, and running the "hard" rule checks
//! that need no model.
//!
//! A profile is a folder of plain files that lives in the user's own private
//! repository. Nothing in this crate writes to it except through explicit calls.
