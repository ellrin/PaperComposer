# Writing profile template

A writing profile is your personal phrase bank, vocabulary preferences and checking
rules. **Keep your real profile in a private repository.** This folder only holds
demo data so the app runs out of the box.

## Use it

1. Create a private repository and copy every file in this folder into it.
2. Replace the demo rows with your own.
3. Tell the app where it is, in either way:
   - environment variable `PAPERCOMPOSER_PROFILE=/path/to/your/profile`
   - or `profile_path = "/path/to/your/profile"` in the app config file
     (`~/Library/Application Support/PaperComposer/config.toml` on macOS,
     `%APPDATA%\PaperComposer\config.toml` on Windows,
     `~/.config/PaperComposer/config.toml` on Linux).

The config file is outside every repository, so your path is never committed.

## Files

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `profile.toml` | Name, `schema_version`, default language |
| `phrases.csv` | Sentence patterns you like to use |
| `vocabulary.csv` | Words to avoid and what to write instead |
| `rules.csv` | Paragraph checks |
| `exemplars.csv` | Whole paragraphs that show your voice |
| `equations.csv` | Formulas you insert often |

Edit them in any spreadsheet app; save as UTF-8 CSV.

### phrases.csv

| Column | Required | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | yes | Unique id, e.g. `P001` |
| `section` | yes | `Abstract`, `Introduction`, `Related work`, `Method`, `Result`, `Discussion`, `Conclusion`, or `Any` |
| `function` | yes | What the sentence does: `research_gap`, `finding`, `limitation`, … (free text, keep it consistent) |
| `position` | yes | `opening`, `body`, `closing` or `transition` |
| `template` | yes | The pattern; `{slot}` marks what to fill in |
| `example` | no | A real sentence using the pattern |
| `tags` | no | Free tags, separated by `;` |
| `priority` | no | 1–5, higher is suggested first (default 3) |

### vocabulary.csv

`avoid` (required), `prefer` (optional replacement), `note`.

### rules.csv

| Column | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `id` | Unique id |
| `type` | `hard` = checked instantly by code; `soft` = needs a model |
| `scope` | `paragraph`, `sentence`, or `section:<Name>` |
| `check` | Hard checks: `sentence_count` (threshold `3-8`), `max_words` (threshold `35`), `banned_words` (uses vocabulary.csv). Soft checks: any name; the model reads `message` |
| `threshold` | Depends on `check` |
| `severity` | `info`, `warning` or `error` |
| `message` | Short text shown when the rule fires |

## Schema version

`schema_version` lets the app upgrade your files when columns change. The app commits
a backup before any upgrade.
